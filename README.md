Hello My friends, this is my first website it was made by me about after trying many times.


Doing something new.
I want to do new something
but don't know what can i do.
I don't know my passion even Hobbies also.


I am a student of engineering college at Ludhiana Punjab
I choose Mechanical engineering but why I don't know. but  I want to give my best in this field.
My one Semester is passed but I gain One supply of Maths but due internal marks I improve my marks by giving Make-up exam and i will pass it.
Now I'm in second semester. In this semester all subjects are good but PPS and English it's like practical knowledge. because English i think it is easy but when classes starts then number of students don't want attend the English class even our English Mam think about this but never said anything. 
PPS is good subject if take some interest if not take interest then it was like a burden evev in this  subject I'm also like if i do right and compile programs if program no run then it was not like by me Even in the lecture only 15 -25 Percent i get it on my mind.
